X86-64 Sail Model
=================

This repository contains a subset of formal specification of the x86-64 architecture. It's written in [Sail](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/).

Here our primary goal is to implement a just-enough part of x86-64 architecture, so as to perform formal verification on [CKB-VM](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm).
